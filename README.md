4Runner-Telemetry
=================

Display and record telemety of a Toyota 4Runner. 

This project was something I started mostly as an interesting way to try to learn a little about electronic engineering. It's scope of use is pretty narrow but I've always been a fan of open source.

As I'm sure you have noticed, this project is incomplete. Actually, at this time there is nothing here except this readme! I needed to confirm the location in order to add a URL to the various aspects of this project.
