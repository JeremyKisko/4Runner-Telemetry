OBDII J1850 Variable Pulse Width to WiFi Comunication Module
=================

Just a simple module to allow you to connect to the J1850 VPW OBDII protocol via WiFi based on the ELM322 chip. This was developed to be permanently mounted in my Toyota 4Runner but it should work on any vehicle using the same protocol.

This project was something I started mostly as an interesting way to try to learn a little about electronic engineering. It's scope of use is pretty narrow but I've always been a fan of open source.

As I'm sure you have noticed, this project is incomplete. Actually, at this time there is nothing here except this readme! I needed to confirm the location in order to add a URL to the various aspects of this project.
